# Experimental Design: A Summary for Business Viability

## What It Is
Experimental design is a structured, statistical approach to determining causal relationships between variables. It involves manipulating one or more independent variables (treatments) and observing the effect on a dependent variable (outcome), typically through randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

---

## How It Is Applied
1. **Define the hypothesis**: What cause-effect relationship are you testing?
2. **Identify treatment and control groups**: Randomly assign subjects to these groups.
3. **Apply the treatment**: Introduce the independent variable to the treatment group.
4. **Measure outcomes**: Collect data on the dependent variable(s).
5. **Analyze results**: Use statistical methods to evaluate the effect of the treatment.

---

## Requirements for Successful Application
- **Randomization**: Subjects must be randomly assigned to groups to minimize bias.
- **Sufficient sample size**: Enough data points are needed to detect meaningful effects (statistical power).
- **Reliable data collection**: Accurate and consistent measurement of variables.
- **Controlled environment**: Ability to isolate the treatment effect from confounding variables.
- **Resources**: Time, budget, and tools to design, execute, and analyze the experiment properly.

---

## When It Is Not Applicable
- **Lack of control over variables**: Cannot isolate the effect of the treatment.
- **Ethical or practical constraints**: Randomization or treatment is infeasible (e.g., denying a critical service).
- **Small sample sizes**: Insufficient data can lead to unreliable conclusions.
- **High variability or noise**: Can obscure treatment effects.
- **Long feedback loops**: When outcomes take too long to manifest.

## Important Questions to Ask the Domain Expert
1. Can the treatment be implemented without significant risk or ethical concerns?
2. Is it feasible to randomly assign units to treatment and control groups?
3. What are the key outcome metrics and how are they measured?
4. Are there any known confounding factors that could influence results?
5. How quickly can we observe the impact of the intervention?
6. Is the business environment stable enough for the duration of the experiment?

## Typical Use Cases
- **Marketing**: A/B testing of ads, emails, or website designs.
- **Product development**: Testing new features or UI changes.
- **Operations**: Evaluating process changes or resource allocation strategies.
- **Healthcare**: Clinical trials for new treatments.
- **Policy-making**: Measuring effects of public interventions or incentives.
