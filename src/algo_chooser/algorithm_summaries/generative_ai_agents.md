# Generative AI Agents: Summary for Business Viability

## What is a Generative AI Agent?
Generative AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems powered by large language models (LLMs) or other generative models. They can interpret tasks, make decisions, and produce content or actions—often in natural language—based on learned patterns and logic.

## How It Is Applied
- **Customer support automation** (chatbots, helpdesk agents)
- **Internal process automation** (e.g. drafting reports, data entry)
- **Research and summarization** (e.g. scanning documents, summarizing findings)
- **Creative content generation** (e.g. marketing copy, design mockups)
- **Coding and development** (e.g. AI dev assistants)
- **Workflow orchestration** (multi-step reasoning, interacting with APIs or databases)

## Requirements for Successful Application
### **Data Requirements**
- Access to high-quality, structured/unstructured data
- Domain-specific examples to fine-tune or guide model behavior (e.g., prompts, retrieval-augmented generation)
- Clear task definitions and outcomes

### **Resource Requirements**
- **Technical infrastructure**: Cloud computing or API access to LLMs
- **Integration capability**: APIs, RPA tools, databases, or third-party systems
- **Human oversight**: For error-checking and model feedback
- **Security & compliance**: Governance of sensitive data handling

## When It Is Not Applicable
- **High-accuracy tasks with no tolerance for error** (e.g. legal compliance, medical diagnosis)
- **Tasks requiring deep, symbolic reasoning or long-term memory**
- **Lack of high-quality data or clear task structure**
- **Highly dynamic or fast-changing domains** (where outdated models may mislead)
- **Strong latency or cost constraints** (real-time systems may be bottlenecked)

## Key Questions to Ask the Business Domain Expert
- What are the **inputs and desired outputs** of the task?
- Is the task **rule-based, generative, or decision-heavy**?
- What are the **error tolerances or risk thresholds**?
- How **structured or unstructured** is the existing data?
- Are there existing **processes or systems** the AI agent needs to interact with?
- How **frequent and repeatable** is the task?
- What would **success** look like if automated or enhanced?

## Typical Use Cases
- Automating repetitive internal tasks (e.g., summarizing customer complaints)
- Enhancing customer-facing interactions (e.g., product support)
- Drafting internal or external communications
- Guiding employees through complex procedures (interactive SOP agents)
- Extracting insights from large text/data volumes
- Assisting knowledge workers (AI copilots in writing, coding, etc.)
