# Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Business Viability Summary

## What is RPA?

**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** is a technology that uses software “robots” to mimic human interactions with digital systems to automate rule-based, repetitive tasks. These bots interact with applications through the user interface, just like a human would, but faster and with greater accuracy.

## How is RPA Applied?

RPA is commonly applied to:
- Extract data from emails, forms, or documents
- Enter data into systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, spreadsheets)
- Reconcile information between systems
- Generate reports or notifications
- Automate workflows across legacy and modern systems

These automations are built using visual design tools (no-code/low-code) and can be deployed on desktops or servers.

## Requirements for Successful Application

To implement RPA successfully, the following are typically required:

### **Data Requirements**
- Structured and consistent input data
- Clear business rules with low variability
- Stable data sources and formats

### **Process Requirements**
- Rule-based (not reliant on human judgment)
- High-volume and repetitive
- Well-defined, documented workflows

### **Resource Requirements**
- RPA platform or tools (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism)
- IT support for bot deployment, maintenance, and integration
- Business analysts to document processes and translate requirements

## When RPA is Not Applicable

RPA is **not suitable** for:
- Processes requiring complex decision-making or unstructured judgment
- Highly variable workflows with frequent exceptions
- Tasks that rely on unstructured data (e.g., handwritten forms or ambiguous text) unless combined with AI
- Systems with unstable UIs (frequent changes break bots)

## Key Questions to Ask the Business Domain Expert

To determine RPA suitability, ask:
1. Is the process rule-based and repetitive?
2. Are the inputs structured and consistent?
3. How often does the process change?
4. How many exceptions or errors occur during the process?
5. What systems and applications are involved?
6. Is the process high-volume enough to justify automation?
7. Are there any compliance or audit trail requirements?

## Common Use Cases

RPA is typically used in:
- **Finance & Accounting**: invoice processing, expense approvals, reconciliations
- **Customer Service**: data entry, ticket routing, FAQs
- **HR**: employee onboarding, payroll processing
- **Healthcare**: patient record updates, claims processing
- **Supply Chain**: order processing, inventory updates
- **IT**: automated user provisioning, routine diagnostics
