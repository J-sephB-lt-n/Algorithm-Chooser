# Supervised Learning: Summary for Business Viability

## What It Is
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labeled datasetâ€”each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output and can then make predictions on new, unseen data.

## How It Is Applied
Supervised learning is applied by:
- Collecting labeled training data (input-output pairs)
- Choosing and training a model (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, SVMs)
- Evaluating performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Deploying the model to make predictions on new inputs

Common tasks include:
- **Classification** (e.g., spam detection, churn prediction)
- **Regression** (e.g., sales forecasting, price estimation)

## Requirements for Successful Application

### Data Requirements
- **Labeled Data**: Sufficient quantity of accurately labeled examples
- **Quality**: Clean, relevant, and representative data
- **Balanced Classes**: For classification, avoid severe class imbalance unless handled appropriately

### Resource Requirements
- **Domain Expertise**: For labeling data and interpreting results
- **Computational Resources**: For training and running models (especially for large datasets or complex models)
- **Time and Budget**: For data collection, cleaning, model training, and validation

## Situations Where It Is Not Applicable or Performs Poorly
- **Lack of Labeled Data**: Supervised learning cannot function without labeled examples
- **Rapidly Changing Environments**: Models trained on historical data may not generalize to new patterns
- **High Variance or Noise**: Excessive noise in the data reduces predictive accuracy
- **Rare Events**: When positive outcomes are extremely rare (e.g., fraud detection) without proper handling

## Important Questions to Ask a Domain Expert
1. Do we have historical data with known outcomes (labels)?
2. Are the outcomes we care about clearly defined and measurable?
3. Is the available data representative of future scenarios?
4. How frequently do the patterns in the data change?
5. What level of accuracy or performance is acceptable for the business?
6. What are the costs of false positives vs. false negatives?

## Typical Scenarios for Supervised Learning
- Email spam classification
- Customer churn prediction
- Credit scoring and risk assessment
- Demand forecasting
- Sentiment analysis
- Disease diagnosis from medical images
- Quality control in manufacturing
