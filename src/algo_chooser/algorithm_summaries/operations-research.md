# ðŸ§  Operations Research: Summary for Business Viability

## What It Is
Operations Research (OR) is a discipline that uses advanced analytical methodsâ€”such as mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and optimizationâ€”to help make better decisions and solve complex problems.

## How It Is Applied
OR involves:
- **Defining the problem** clearly and quantitatively
- **Formulating mathematical models** to represent real-world systems (e.g., linear programming, queuing models, simulation)
- **Analyzing and solving** these models using algorithms or heuristics
- **Interpreting results** to inform decision-making and strategy

Common tools include:
- Optimization (linear, integer, nonlinear)
- Simulation
- Decision analysis
- Network models
- Queueing theory

## Requirements for Successful Application
- **High-quality data**: Accurate, sufficient, and relevant data is critical
- **Well-defined objectives**: Clear goals (e.g., minimize cost, maximize throughput)
- **Quantifiable constraints and parameters**
- **Domain expertise**: To validate models and interpret results
- **Computational resources**: Depending on problem complexity, may require substantial computing power

## Situations Where OR Is *Not* Applicable or Performs Poorly
- **Poor or missing data**: Inaccurate or unavailable data undermines model reliability
- **Ill-defined or qualitative objectives**: Difficult to model soft goals like customer satisfaction or brand perception
- **Dynamic or chaotic environments**: Where systems change rapidly or unpredictably (e.g., crisis scenarios)
- **Highly political or emotional decisions**: Where data-driven decisions may be resisted regardless of results

## Key Questions to Ask the Business Domain Expert
- What is the *primary objective* (e.g., cost reduction, service improvement)?
- What *constraints* must be respected (e.g., budget, capacity, regulations)?
- What *data* is available, and how reliable is it?
- What *decisions* need to be made? Are they quantifiable?
- How *dynamic* is the environmentâ€”are the rules or inputs changing frequently?
- Are there any *non-quantifiable factors* influencing the decision?

## Typical Use Cases
- **Supply Chain Optimization**
- **Workforce Scheduling**
- **Transportation & Logistics Planning**
- **Inventory Management**
- **Manufacturing Process Optimization**
- **Telecommunications Network Design**
- **Healthcare Operations (e.g., patient flow, resource allocation)**
