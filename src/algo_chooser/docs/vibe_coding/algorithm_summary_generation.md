I'm trying to decide whether {{ algorithm_name }} is a viable solution to my business problem. Please write me a concise summary of {{ algorithm_name }}, specifically including:

- what it is
- how it is applied
- requirements in order for it to be successfully applied (data requirements, resource requirements etc.)
- situations in which it is not applicable (or perform particularly badly)
- import questions to ask the business problem domain expert in order to assess whether it is applicable to this particular problem
- scenarios in which it is typically used

Please format your response as markdown
